**JavaScript Microblogging App**
A simple microblogging application built with JavaScript, allowing users to create, view, and interact with blogs. Each blog consists of a title, content, author, and creation date. This application does not persist data on a server; it's for educational purposes and demonstrates JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills.

**The JavaScript Microblogging App incorporates the following key elements and features:**

1. View Existing Blogs
As a user, you can effortlessly browse through a list of existing blogs fetched from a JSON file. Each blog is displayed with its title, author, and a brief snippet of the content.
2. Expand Blog Content
By simply clicking on a blog, you can smoothly expand the content to read the full post, thanks to CSS transitions that enhance the user experience.
3. Create New Blog
You have the option to create a new blog by clicking the "Create" button. This action opens an editable card, allowing you to input your blog details. Please note that these changes are not persisted, making it a safe space for drafting blog ideas.
4. Add a Blog
You can add a blog by providing a title, content, and author details. The "created" field is automatically populated with the current date and time, streamlining the blogging process.
5. Update a Blog
The application permits you to mark a blog as complete by clicking an update icon. While doing so, you can edit the content and author fields for further refinement.
6. Focused JavaScript Development
The project focuses on building a robust JavaScript application, helping you improve your JavaScript skills.
7. Styling with SCSS
The user interface is styled using SCSS (Sass) to ensure a clean and visually appealing design.
8. Extensive Code Documentation
The codebase is extensively documented, making it easy for developers to understand and customize the application.
9. Version Control
The project includes a .gitignore file to specify which files or directories should be ignored by Git.
